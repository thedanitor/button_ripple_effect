# Button Ripple Effect

https://thedanitor.github.io/button_ripple_effect/

This project is from the Day 20 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what certain lines of code do. After making it through the first 20 projects I don't need to make as many comments as I have been since some of the styles and functions are becoming second-nature to me, but I will still point out new or note worthy lines.

### Overall Impression

Cool button effect! Learning about clientX, Y and e.target.offsetTop, Left is very helpful in determining where user clicked on an element. I will definitely store that away for use in other applications.

### Things Learned

* For animation property, define animation name and duration. Then describe animation using @keyframes with the animation name
* clientX, clientY are properties of a mouse event that return horizontal or vertical coordinate within viewport
* "this" keyword works differently inside arrow functions
