# Button Ripple Effect

https://thedanitor.github.io/button_ripple_effect/

This project is from the Day 20 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what certain lines of code do. After making it through the first 20 projects I don't need to make as many comments as I have been since some of the styles and functions are becoming second-nature to me, but I will still point out new or note worthy lines.
